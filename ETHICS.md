# Ethics Declaration

This document outlines the ethical guidelines for the use and development of the Internet Asset Intelligence Platform.

## Responsible Use

This software is intended for legitimate security research, asset management, and threat intelligence purposes. It must not be used for any illegal, unethical, or unauthorized activities, including but not limited to:

*   Unauthorized access to systems.
*   Disruption of services.
*   Malicious scanning or reconnaissance against targets without explicit consent.

## Data Privacy and Consent

*   **Default Behavior:** The platform's default configuration is set to scan only local and private IP addresses (RFC1918 and loopback). Public internet scanning is strictly opt-in.
*   **Public Scanning Authorization:** Scanning public IP ranges requires explicit, auditable consent from the asset owner or a legally recognized Proof of Authorization (POA).
*   **Data Handling:** Collected data will be handled with utmost care, adhering to privacy regulations and internal data retention policies.

## Transparency and Accountability

*   All administrative actions, especially those related to enabling public scanning or modifying core configurations, are logged immutably for auditability.
*   The system is designed with explainable risk scoring to provide transparency into how risk assessments are made.

## Reporting Misuse or Abuse

Any suspected misuse or abuse of this platform should be reported immediately to [abuse@example.com]. We are committed to investigating all reports thoroughly and taking appropriate action.
